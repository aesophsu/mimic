Note 2. SMD > 0.1 indicates a significant imbalance between groups.,,,,,,,
Note 3. SMD (MIMIC vs eICU) quantifies distributional drift between development and external validation cohorts.,,,,,,,
Note 4. — indicates feature not collected in eICU validation cohort; handled via cross-center alignment in model deployment.,,,,,,,
Note 5. P/F ratio: Both MIMIC and eICU use PaO2/FiO2 from arterial blood gas only; eICU sets NULL when PaO2 unavailable (aligned definition).,,,,,,,
